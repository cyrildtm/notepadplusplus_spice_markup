# notepadplusplus_spice_markup
Notepad++ user defined language (UDL) for SPICE

Markup styles for ngspice, the open-source circuit simulator. Now comes with classical and dark mode. 
The stock one that comes with NPP is ... not very helpful IMO. 

The XML files should be self-explanatory; otherwise, you may also check the styles by importing them in Notepad++. 
They should cover most of basic keywords in ngspice. I have another one for Cider, the built-in device simulator, work-in-progress.
